# Maze Solver
A maze solver made using the JavaFX library. The algorithm employs a depth first search to solve any valid maze inputs,  which can be loaded dynamically using the GUI. The solving process can be stepped through to see how the maze is solved step-by-step. These partially solved mazes can also be loaded & saved through the program. The validity of the .txt input mazes are also checked, and must be formatted to ensure they have a single entrance, single exit, and a valid route through the maze.
